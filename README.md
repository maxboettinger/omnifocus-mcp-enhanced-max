⚠️ Vibe coded fork - use at your own risk. Project is (not yet) in a state where I'd endorse it.

## Changes

- Fixed issue with adding tags
- `edit_tasks` now also allows for adding/updating the project of a give task
- added `get_next_inbox_item` tool that receives oldes item from inbox (ideal when working on clearing the inbox, as the llm does not need to read ALL inbox items every time)
- added test suite
